# Getting started

## Overview: what we’re installing and what it all does

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): package manager for MacOS
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html): needed to run eXist-db (Java Development Kit [JDK], not Java Runtime Edition [JRE])
* [eXist-db](https://exist-db.org): XML database and application server (requires Java)
* [&lt;oXygen/&gt;](https://www.oxygenxml.com/): XML editor and IDE (integrated development environment)
* [Git](https://github.com/): version control
* [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/existdb): programming editor with eXist-db and Git integration
* [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/): environment for Jupyter Lab, in which we’ll practice XPath and XQuery
* [CLI eXist-db app generator](https://github.com/eXist-db/generator-exist)
