# Before you arrive 

## Travel reimbursement

The Institute will reimburse travel expenses for participants up to the ceiling prices we communicated earlier. Here is some additional information:

1. In order to reimburse ticket costs you will need to provide an itemized receipt that outlines the flight plan, taxes, and any fees associated with the 
ticket purchase. The receipt must also include the last four digits of the card used to charge the purchase. You do not need to provide boarding passes.
Please submit all receipts in PDF format.
2. All flights must observe NEH [Fly America](fly-america.pdf) requirements. 
3. We will reimburse mileage costs for use of your personal car at the 
official [GSA rate](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/transportation-airfare-pov-etc/privately-owned-vehicle-pov-mileage-reimbursement-rates) that is in place at the time of the travel.
 
## Software installation

Before you arrive please [install the software](../ref/installs.md) we will use during the Institute. We have allocated time during the first day to
ensure that participants are able to install all software successfully, so don’t worry if you get stuck, but anything that you can install 
ahead of time will help us move on to using the software more quickly. 

## Command line tutorial 

Prior knowledge of or experience with the command line is not required, but we encourage participants who are new to the command line environment
to work through the [SW Carpentry’s Tutorial on the Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). (Despite the name this tutorial is
not Unix-specific. MacOS users should use the MacOS terminal or an alternative (we use and recommend [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)); Windows users
should use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) (not PowerShell or the regular Windows command shell).
