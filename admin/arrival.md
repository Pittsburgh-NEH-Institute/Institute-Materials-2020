# Arrival instructions 

## Getting from the airport to the University of Pittsburgh 

### 28X bus 

The bus fare for all buses is $2.75 (this will be your cheapest transportation option). Exact change is required. Alternatively, you can purchase a [ConnectCard](http://www.connectcard.org/) from a kiosk in the baggage claim area. To catch the bus, exit the airport from door number 2 and wait at the bus stop (look for a blue and white sign). When boarding the bus, enter from the front door, then feed your money into the farebox. If you purchased a ConnectCard, tap the card onto the orange scanner located on the top of the farebox. Note that drivers will not assist with luggage and space may vary on the bus. 

The 28X runs about twice an hour and is in service from 4 a.m. to midnight. To track the bus and get an approximate arrival time, you can download the [Transit app](https://transitapp.com/) and set your destination to 260 South Bouquet Street (this is the address for Bouquet Gardens B, where you will be checking in on July 10th). The trip from the airport to the University of Pittsburgh lasts about one hour. 

### Super Shuttle 

[Super Shuttle](https://www.supershuttle.com) is a shared-ride van service that you can book ahead [online](https://www.supershuttle.com/locations/pittsburghpit/), via phone (1 800-258-3826), or in person at the airport upon arrival. You can get an estimate for pricing on their [website](https://www.supershuttle.com/blog/find-advance-pricing-supershuttle/) for either one-way or round trips. List your arrival destination as “260 South Bouquet Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213” (Bouquet B, your check-in location). 

### Taxi 

Taxi service is available at the airport (same side as the 28X bus) and does not need to be booked ahead. Fare is generally around $60 (not including gratuity). Tell the driver “Bouquet Gardens at the University of Pittsburgh”. Follow directions to Bouquet B at 260 South Bouquet Street. 

### Uber and Lyft

Uber and Lyft are ride-sharing services available via phone app. Download either the Uber or Lyft app from the app store, input your information, and list “260 South Bouquet Street” as your destination. Fares vary with demand, but typically cost between $30 and $70 (not including gratuity). When you arrive, head to the Bouquet B building, which will be just ahead when you arrive. 

### Driving directions

You should plan to arrive at the [Posvar](https://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour/wesley-w-posvar-hall) garage, where you will be able to park for the duration of the Institute (you will receive a parking pass upon arrival). The garage entrance is located across the street from [Mervis Hall](https://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour/mervis-hall), at [3950 Roberto Clemente Dr, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mervis+Hall,+3950+Roberto+Clemente+Dr,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15260/@40.440793,-79.9707917,14z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x8834f22805963667:0x1cd8662079624d2e!2sMervis+Hall,+3950+Roberto+Clemente+Dr,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15260!3b1!8m2!3d40.440793!4d-79.9532822!3m4!1s0x8834f22805963667:0x1cd8662079624d2e!8m2!3d40.440793!4d-79.9532822). Using this address, you will be able to easily locate the entrance to the parking garage. After you have parked, head to Bouquet B at 260 South Bouquet Street (about a five minute walk from the garage) to check in. 

## Arrival at Bouquet Gardens 

### Check-in day

When you arrive on July 10th, there will be a dedicated check-in area at Bouquet B of [Bouquet Gardens](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/housing-services/university-owned-housing/bouquet-gardens), where you will be staying in one of the buildings. Check-in will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but if you arrive outside of this time frame, you can still check-in to your room by heading to the guard station at Bouquet J (315 Oakland Avenue). If you require any assistance on your day of arrival, you can contact Emma Schwarz, the Institute's Senior Assistant, whose contact information will be sent to participants prior to the beginning of the Institute.  

## Preparing for your trip 

### Weather 

Pittsburgh weather in July tends to be hot and humid, with frequent thunderstorms. Temperatures average around 85° F (30° C). You’ll want to bring an umbrella, rain jacket, and comfortable walking shoes. Although it is not usually a tropical place, Pittsburgh in July requires sunscreen, water, and patience. Bouquet Gardens is air-conditioned, as are all buildings on campus.

### Power adapters and technology 

Since power supplies and wall outlets vary throughout the world, please be sure to bring your own power adapter/converter. Global converters are acceptable, but you can also purchase ones specifically for the [United States](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/united-states-of-america/). We do not recommend bringing any foreign hairdryers, straighteners, or curling irons.

### Cultural norms

Although there are many things you may find different about the United States, the most important may be gratuities. Gratuities will probably not be included in any of your bills at restaurants, and 20% is recommended. If you are paying with a card, waitstaff will take your card away from the table, process it, and bring back a check with a blank space on which you can write your tip amount and calculate your final total. If you are using cash, leave the gratuity on the table for the waitstaff to collect after you leave. Tipping by handing money directly to waitstaff can be awkward: they will know to look for a tip without your drawing attention to it. A gratuity is also expected when riding in taxis, Ubers, and Lyfts, but not allowed on Port Authority buses or trains. [Other information](https://www.interexchange.org/american-culture/cultural-customs-us/) about cultural differences can be found online, but Americans are friendly enough that you should feel comfortable asking if you’re uncertain or confused about something.

### Quick reminders

* Inform your bank and credit card company that you are traveling, even if you’re coming from within the United States.
* Refill your prescriptions, or arrange for them to be made available at a local pharmacy. If you are arriving from abroad, you will likely want to avoid filling any prescriptions in the U.S., as medication can be prohibitively expensive without an international health insurance plan.
* Stop your mail, or arrange for someone to pick it up while you’re away.
* Check your cell phone plan’s international coverage and adjust if necessary.
