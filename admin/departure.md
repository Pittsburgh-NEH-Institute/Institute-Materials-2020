You can get directions to the bus stop by entering "Atwood Station" into Google Maps. The stop is about a six minute walk away from Bouquet Gardens. Wait for the bus on [the side of the street with the glass bus shelters (in front of UPMC Presbyterian)](https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/port-authority-s-atwood). Bus fare is $2.75. The bus will take you straight to the airport (the ride lasts about one hour). Stay on the bus until the signage at the front of the bus reads "Pgh Airport Upper Level" (or something akin to this).

From there, you will be able to check your bags (if needed), then pass through airport security. You will then take a tram to your gate. 

### Uber/Lyft

Enter "Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT)" as your destination. The ride to the airport can take up to an hour, depending on traffic.

Once you enter the airport, you will be able to find the desk for checking your bags (if needed). Then, you will descend to the security area, then take a tram to your gate. 

### Taxi 

Tell the driver that you are headed to the airport, then follow the same instructions above for navigating within the airport.
