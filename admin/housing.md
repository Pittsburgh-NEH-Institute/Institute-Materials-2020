At check-in you will receive a PUC (Panther Utility Card) and you will need to sign that you received the card. This will give you access to your assigned residence hall and room. This card is active and valid only to your assigned residence room. You may also use it to ride Pitt Shuttles. It will not give access to Port Authority buses, gyms or other spaces on campus.    

## Lodging: Bouquet Gardens

### Location

You will be staying at Bouquet G in Bouquet Gardens. If you are arriving from outside the U.S., you can list the address for Bouquet G as your address on any travel documents that require it. Some details, maps, and photos of the building are available [here](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/housing-services/university-owned-housing/bouquet-gardens).

### Guest policy 

Summer participants may not have guests unless they are housed in Bouquet Gardens Only. Because participants are not acting in the capacity of Pitt students, they will be limited to immediate family as guests. All approved guests MUST sign in.

### Residence Hall and University Facilities 

Access to facilities (i.e. Gym, Music Rooms, Rec Rooms) in the Residence Hall are prohibited. Summer guests will not have access to Pitt facilities such as gyms, libraries, etc. Summer guests will not be given Port Authority access on their PUC cards to pay for bus fares. 

### Roommates 

Roommates will be decided by the program organizer. Roommate changes can be inquired to your program organizer who will contact the Conference Services Coordinator for approval.

### Assigned floors 

Summer participants are not allowed on any other floors other than the floor of their designated room. This includes common areas, bathrooms, etc. not assigned on your floor.

### Room cleanliness 

Participants are responsible for their own trash removal. Housekeeping will provide each room with a complimentary trash bag at arrival but will not go into rooms once they are occupied to change and remove trash. Trash rooms are located on the floor of the residence hall, or a dumpster is located outside of the building. Participants are responsible for buying their own toiletries. Housekeeping will only be providing 3 rolls of toilet paper per room. After these rolls have run out, it is up to the participants to purchase a new supply. Rooms must be kept in a cleanly state in order to avoid health risks of all occupants of the building. Excessive amounts of trash or necessary clean up required by our staff could result in additional fees. 

### Laundry 

Please locate the laundry rooms located in your Residence Hall. These should be located on every floor. Machines are operated by Panther Funds. If your program does not provide Panther Funds to participants, Panther Funds may be loaded onto your PUC card at Panther Central. Detergent is not provided. 

### Linen exchanges 

Linens include a fitted sheet, top, sheet, thin cotton blanket, pillow, pillowcase, washcloth and towel. Linen Exchange will take place on Mondays from 4pm to 8pm. Linens (except pillow and blanket) should be brought down to the lobby and exchanged at the Conferences Services Assistant table.

### Damages 

If damages are reported or found the group or individual will be subject to additional fees.

### Animals 

The University of Pittsburgh has a strict no-pet policy in on-campus housing. For guidance and policy on service and emotional support animals please contact [Disability Resources and Services](https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/disability-access/disability-resources-and-services/accommodations/service-animals-and-emotional).

### Internet 

All summer guests will have access to Wifi within their Residence Halls. Summer guests should connect to the **SummerGuest-WiFi** network. Upon connecting to the SummerGuest-WiFi network, users will be directed to enter a passcode key. The passcode will be emailed directly to Institute participants. 

## Residence Hall amenities

Each suite has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a shared kitchen. Participants will share a suite with one other person, so each person has two rooms and a private bathroom. In addition to the provided linens, we recommend that you bring your own blanket or comforter, along with additional pillows or towels, should you wish.

Kitchens are equipped with a refrigerator, stove, oven, and sink. Plates, cups, mugs, and flatware are not provided, nor are pots or pans. The Institute will provide money for meals in the form of PantherFunds, so you will not need to do your own cooking, but if you wish to bring any cooking or eating utensils or small appliances (such as a coffee maker), you are welcome to do so. 

**The following appliances are allowed (but not included) in Residence Halls:** microwaves (800 watts or smaller); refrigerators (4.2 cubic feet or smaller); coffee makers without burners; blenders; computers; TVs, DVD players, and radios; non-commercial hair dryers and hairstyling tools; electric shavers; electric toothbrushes; and irons (with auto shutoff). 

**The following appliances are *prohibited* in all Residence Halls. (This is not an all-inclusive list, if you are unsure if an item is permitted please contact Panther Central or Conference Services):** open-flame cooking devices or heating units; space heaters; air conditioners; halogen light fixtures; gas grills; extension cords (power strips with surge protectors are acceptable); unauthorized pets; loft beds; waterbeds; exterior radio/TV aerials; controlled substances; firecrackers; ammunition; firearms or any other weapons; live cut decorations such as trees; and candles.

## Meals 

Your Panther Utility Card will come loaded with PantherFunds, which you can use to purchase food both on campus and at restaurants and stores in the surrounding area of Oakland. $45 per day in PantherFunds have been allotted to each Institute participant for purchasing meals. [Forbes Street Market](https://dineoncampus.com/pitt/forbes-street-market) accepts PantherFunds and offers groceries and quick meals. It is conveniently located right across the street from David Lawrence Hall, where Institute sessions are held. Other University food merchants can be found [here](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/panther-card/merchants/university-merchants). PantherFunds can also be used at restaurants, grocery stores, and other vendors. Places that you can expect to find around campus include sit-down restaurants, fast food, and coffee shops. An up-to-date list of these establishments can be found [here](https://acceptinglocations.com/pantherfunds/).
