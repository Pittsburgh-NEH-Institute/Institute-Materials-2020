# Housing details 

## Arrival and check-in 

If you are arriving on July 10th, your check-in location for housing will be Bouquet B ([260 South Bouquet Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213](https://www.google.com/maps/place/260+S+Bouquet+St,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15213/@40.4407162,-79.9568502,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8834f22824211307:0xaabc42957e8f2d45!8m2!3d40.4407121!4d-79.9546615)). This regular check-in starts at 12 p.m. and closes at 6 p.m., but should you arrive earlier or later than that, you can still check in by heading to the guard station at Bouquet J at [315 Oakland Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/315+Oakland+Ave,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15213/@40.4398923,-79.9563888,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8834f187f3440103:0x16758f80690088b6!8m2!3d40.4398882!4d-79.9542001). The guard station is available 24/7. At check-in you will receive a PUC (Panther Utility Card). This will give you access to your assigned residence hall and room in Bouquet Gardens. 

Your PUC also serves as your meal card (see below) and you can use it to ride the [Pitt Shuttles](https://www.pts.pitt.edu/mobility/shuttle-services/pitt-shuttle-schedule). It will not give access to Port Authority buses, gyms or other spaces on campus.

## Lodging: Bouquet Gardens

### Location

You will be staying in one of the buildings at [Bouquet Gardens](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/housing-services/university-owned-housing/bouquet-gardens). If you are arriving from outside the U.S., you can list the address for Bouquet G (235 Oakland Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213) as your address on any travel documents that require it.

### Residence Hall and University Facilities 

Access to facilities (e.g., gym, music rooms, rec rooms) in the Residence Hall is not permitted and summer guests will also not have access to other Pitt facilities such as gyms; however, participants will have access to the [library](https://www.library.pitt.edu/hillman-library), though they will not be able to check out books. PUC cards issued to summer guests cannot be used for free travel on [city buses](https://www.portauthority.org/inside-Pittsburgh-Regional-Transit/rider-info/how-to-ride/how-to-ride-the-bus/). However, PUC cards can be used to ride the Pitt Shuttles, and the shuttle schedule is [available online](https://www.pts.pitt.edu/mobility/shuttle-services/pitt-shuttle-schedule).

### Roommates 

Housing in Bouquet Gardens is in suites with two persons per suite. Participants have been pre-assigned to suites; if you need to change your assignment, contact our Senior Institute Assistant Emma Schwarz (contact information will be provided on arrival) and she will follow up with the Conference Services Coordinator to make the necessary arrangements.

### Room cleanliness 

Participants are responsible for their own trash removal. Housekeeping will provide each room with a complimentary trash bag at arrival but will not go into rooms once they are occupied to clean the rooms or to change and remove trash. Trash rooms are located on each floor of the residence hall and a dumpster is located outside of the building. Participants are responsible for buying their own toiletries, but will be provided with a small bar of soap upon arrival. Housekeeping will provide two rolls of toilet paper per room, so once that runs out, you will need to purchase more. 

### Laundry 

Institute participants have access to communal laundry rooms on each floor in the Residence Hall. Machines are operated by Panther Funds (the Institute meal plan takes the form of Panther Funds, and additional funds may be loaded onto your PUC card at [Panther Central](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/about-us)). Detergent is not provided. 

### Linen exchanges 

Linens include a fitted sheet, top sheet, thin cotton blanket, pillow, pillowcase, washcloth and towel. If you get cold easily, we recommend that you bring a comforter or blanket along with you. Linen Exchange will take place on Mondays from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Linens (except pillow and blanket) should be brought down to the lobby and exchanged at the Conferences Services Assistant table. 

### Damages 

If damages are reported or found the individual will be subject to additional fees.

### Animals 

The University of Pittsburgh has a strict no-pet policy in on-campus housing. For guidance and policy on service and emotional support animals please contact [Disability Resources and Services](https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/disability-access/disability-resources-and-services/accommodations/service-animals-and-emotional).

### Internet 

All summer guests will have access to WiFi within their Residence Halls. Summer guests should connect to the **SummerGuest-WiFi** network. Upon connecting to the SummerGuest-WiFi network, users will be directed to enter a passcode key. The passcode will be shared with Institute participants on arrival. 

## Residence Hall amenities

Each suite has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a shared kitchen (see immediately below) and living space. All suites are air-conditioned. Institute participants will share a suite with one other person, so that each person will have a private room and a private bathroom. In addition to the provided linens, we recommend that you bring your own blanket or comforter, along with additional pillows or towels, should you wish.

Kitchens are equipped with a refrigerator, stove, microwave oven, oven, and sink. Plates, cups, mugs, and flatware are not provided, nor are pots or pans. The Institute will provide money for meals in the form of Panther Funds (loaded onto your PUC), so you will not need to do your own cooking, but if you wish to bring any cooking or eating utensils or small appliances (such as a coffee maker), you are welcome to do so. 

**The following appliances are allowed (but not included) in Residence Halls:** Coffee makers without burners; blenders; computers; TVs, DVD players, and radios; non-commercial hair dryers and hairstyling tools; electric shavers; electric toothbrushes; and irons (with auto shutoff). 

**The following appliances are *prohibited* in all Residence Halls. (This is not an all-inclusive list, if you are unsure if an item is permitted please contact [Panther Central](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/) or [Conference Services](https://www.conferenceservices.pitt.edu/contact-us-0)):** Open-flame cooking devices or heating units; space heaters; air conditioners; halogen light fixtures; gas grills; extension cords (power strips with surge protectors are acceptable); unauthorized pets; loft beds; waterbeds; exterior radio/TV aerials; controlled substances; firecrackers; ammunition; firearms or any other weapons; live cut decorations such as trees; and candles. 

For more information about amenities available in your residence hall see the Universityâ€™s [Bouquet Gardens information page](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/housing-services/university-owned-housing/bouquet-gardens). 

## Meals 

Your PUC (Panther Utility Card) will come loaded with Panther Funds, which you can use to purchase food both on campus and at restaurants and stores in the surrounding area of Oakland. $45 per day in PantherFunds have been allotted to each Institute participant for purchasing meals. [Forbes Street Market](https://dineoncampus.com/pitt/forbes-street-market) accepts Panther Funds and offers groceries and quick meals. It is conveniently located right across the street from David Lawrence Hall, where Institute sessions are held. Panther Funds are accepted at [many University merchants](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/panther-card/merchants/university-merchants) and at independent [restaurants, fast food establishments, coffee shops, grocery stores, and other vendors](https://acceptinglocations.com/pantherfunds/). Some stores may be located a bit further from campus but can be easily accessed by nearby buses.
