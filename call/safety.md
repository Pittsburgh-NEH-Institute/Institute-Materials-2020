# Safety and security 

## University of Pittsburgh Police 

The University of Pittsburgh Police Department is available 24/7 and covers the Oakland campus, as well as outlying facilities. **To be connected to Pitt police, dial 911 or (412) 624-2121.** For more information about Pitt Police, visit their [website](http://www.police.pitt.edu/).

## Residence hall security 

Entrances to residence halls have security desks staffed by welcome attendants. Welcome Attendants, who are trained in university fire safety and security procedures, control access to the residence halls by requiring that all residents and visitors properly scan in and out of the buildings.

## Emergency blue light phone stations 

There are emergency phones, identifiable by a blue light, located throughout campus. Pressing the red emergency button on one of these phones activates the strobe on the blue light and notifies Pitt Police dispatch of the userâ€™s location, allowing emergency personnel to respond.
