# Before you arrive 

Before you arrive at the Institute, you will want to have installed the following programs and packages on your laptop. Installation instructions for both Mac and Windows users are available [here](https://github.com/Pittsburgh-NEH-Institute/pr-app/blob/main/pr-app-tutorials/installs.md).

## Command line practice 

While prior knowledge of command line is not required, we recommend [SW Carpentryâ€™s Tutorial on the Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) if you would like to familiarize yourself ahead of time.
