# exist- Db controller documentation

Goals and anti-goals
Introduce m.v.c. Or otherwise provide reference materials on it why is a single .xar file better?

What are dependencies? Why are we interested in mitigating them?
Is bootstrap preference still true? Is it worth pursuing CSS and design strategies?

We need to overhaul the "create app skeleton" section to use yeoman instead

"Expand the skeleton" section, while helpful, doesn't follow our general approach to development

Upload XML documents _ how? Why? Move "support for indexing‚Äù to the facets/fields training. This isn't a very organic way to conceive of a laboratory edition.

Create x query scripts inside the modules subcollection for what?

Define: namespace function datatyping .  We need to explain how we know what goes here at the front to make everything work like magic

CSS + JS are the very last of your worries

Our examples aren't developer-y enough, but are Siegel and Retter's, should we be using that more as a textbook than a separate reference? I'm unsure what we're offering here that they aren't

We ought to be showing how incomplete and wrong we're got it most of the time.

I don't know what the controller actually does based on this, but the Siegel and Retter explains that well so I think it's fine.

XInclude is good, but I think we should maybe separate MVC lessons into different pieces and use pipelining framework. We should also be making better use of XInclude.

URL rewriting as a concept should be explained by us and for our audience

System variables should come first in definitions and explainers, we use them constantly.
