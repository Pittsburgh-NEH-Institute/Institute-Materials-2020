# Week 1, Day 5: Friday, 
## Synopsis

Collaborating on the edition. In session one we introduce the TEI ODD (One Document
                Does it all), a mechanism for documenting customizations to the TEI for
                project-specific purposes. Then, instructors lead small groups in applying ODD
                modeling to the laboratory edition. In session two we introduce GitHub Projects, a
                Kanban-style collaboration tool, and guide participants through debugging and
                resolving merge conflicts in Git. In session three we introduce the use of eXist-db
                as a Content Management System so as to prepare participants for active publication
                development in week two. Guest lecturer Jeffrey Witt, General Editor of the
                Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive, closes the day with a special topic
                session on the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), a
                community-focused Linked Open Data (LOD) standard for image sharing.
