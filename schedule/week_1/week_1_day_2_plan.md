# Week 1, Day 2: Tuesday, July 12, 2022
## Synopsis

Project management and planning the edition. After the first day’s emphasis on
                theory, model, and method, day two concentrates on baseline technical topics needed
                to translate edition goals into an implementation plan. We begin the day with Agile
                project management, after which the version control system Git, its online
                collaboration environment GitHub, and project file management best practice are
                introduced. In the afternoon the participants apply these best practices while
                setting up the file system in eXist-db. In the special topic session participants
                explore the command line environment they will use to manage files.
