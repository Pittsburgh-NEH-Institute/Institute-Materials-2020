# Week 1, Day 2: Tuesday, July 12, 2022
## Synopsis

Project management and planning the edition. After the first day’s emphasis on
                theory, model, and method, day two concentrates on baseline technical topics needed
                to translate edition goals into an implementation plan. We begin the day with Agile
                project management, after which the version control system Git, its online
                collaboration environment GitHub, and project file management best practice are
                introduced. We continue to develop our XQuery skills, introducing and practicing
                FLWOR, in anticipation of applying them to edition development. In the afternoon the
                participants apply these best practices while initializing an eXist-db app using
                Yeoman. In a special topic session, Chelsea Gunn presents on project
                sustainability.

## Outcome goals
