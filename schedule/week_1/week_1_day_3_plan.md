# Week 1, Day 3: Wednesday, July 13, 2022
## Synopsis

Moving from model to implementation. The third day is devoted to developing the
                digital editing workflow as a computational pipeline. Session one gives a high-level
                overview of data models for documents, such as TEI XML, LMNL, and TAG. In session
                two we discuss applications of the TEI to digital editions. In the afternoon the
                focus remains on TEI, but extends to implementation, as participants perform
                hands-on group markup activities based on the previous day’s document analysis. The
                special topic session, led by guest lecturer Patrick Juola, professor of computer
                science Duquesne University and developer of the open-source JGAAP stylometry
                toolkit, introduces stylometry as an example of integrating statistical description
                and evaluation into the perspectives exposed within an edition.

## Outcome goals
* Practice file management at the command line.
* Practice Git at the command line.
* Explore how data models and the computational pipeline work together.
* Navigate enabling and enforcing schema paradigms.
* Make explicit our assumptions about TEI, our data, markup decisions, and edition goals.
* Explore the relationship between research questions and markup decisions.
* Consider how the laboratory edition data might look different with different research questions and markup.
* Create our first computational pipeline together.
