            <syn>>The Institute opens with a high-level view of the types of engagement required by
                a textual editor, beginning (always!) from the research questions and leading to the
                production of an actual edition. In session two we introduce the computational
                pipeline as a way of modeling the development of a digital edition. The afternoon
                sessions ground the morning’s theoretical work with a presentation of the research
                goals and materials to be used in the laboratory edition. We discuss document
                analysis and OCR as first steps in the editorial workflow. The special topic session
                of this first day is reserved for participants to install the software packages
                required to work on the laboratory edition, all of which will be provided by the
                Institute.</syn>
