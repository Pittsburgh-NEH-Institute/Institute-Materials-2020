"Nobody has ever made me look at my edition like this before"
vs
"I learned a lot of tricks, but there was no idea behind it"

What they'll learn: project planning, computational pipelines

High-level information that they'll take home and customize for their edition

Adapt layout from old version

We normalize in three places, not just stage 2. We need to be aware of computation to understand that we do near matching late for reasons of efficiency.

"Information extraction" is really implicit extraction because we have to find the structures, but instead of pulling it out we tag it so that we can pull it out later. It's all about making the implicit explicit so that it will be machine-actionable.

Annotation under normalization or markup?

Action items:

Ronald and Elli: Revise and update plan for week 2

David: Tokenization, normalization activities; including materials from Amsterdam workshop
Add <xsl:for-each-group> to XPath activity
