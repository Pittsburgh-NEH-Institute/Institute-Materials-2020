# Transcription and OCR

Modern printed or digital text is already character-based, and using it as the basis of an edition may start with the text as is, with possible conversion into Unicode if it comes to you in a different encoding. You will normally enrich your edition with markup, most commonly [TEI XML](http://www.tei.org), but weâ€™ll discuss some alternatives shortly.

The continuum of transcription styles for transforming handwritten sources to digital character-based representations is usually described as ranging from diplomatic to normalized. A diplomatic transcription attempts to retain details of the orthography, and sometimes even the paleography, of the original.
