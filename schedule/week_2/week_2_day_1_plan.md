# Week 2, Day 1: Monday, July 18, 2022
## Synopsis

Preparing for deployment. In week two, participants prepare the laboratory edition
                for publication, exposing the functionalities of querying, filtering, analyzing, and
                transforming textual data. In session one, we take stock of the progress of our
                collaborative edition and the work plan for completion. In session two we survey
                publication options like TEI Publisher and CETEIcean with comparative reference to
                GitHub Pages and the laboratory edition eXist-db implementation. In the afternoon,
                participants practice transformations with XML technologies, focusing on control
                over design and functionality. The day’s special topic session will be a
                presentation on user experience and design by guest lecturer Shea Higgins.
