# Week 2, Day 4: Thursday, July 21, 2022
## Synopsis

Data access and APIs.** The morning sessions focus on accommodating both the
                developer-user and the eventual end-user. First, participants learn to collaborate
                over GitHub through issues and pull requests. In the second session we introduce
                Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The afternoon’s session allows
                participants to develop a collaborative starter API for the laboratory edition,
                which we will be able to publish and use that day. The final session is reserved for
                review and catch-up.
