# Week 2, Day 2: Tuesday, July 19, 2022
## Synopsis

Implementing publication strategies.** The morning is devoted to HTML and CSS,
                which constitute the “view” aspect of the laboratory edition’s MVC architecture. In
                session two, participants return to the application in eXist-db and gain experience
                with application requirements. In the afternoon, participants deploy the first-draft
                edition within eXist-db with a session that implements the model, view, and
                controller together. To wrap up the day, we'll discuss unit testing and writing
                functions.
