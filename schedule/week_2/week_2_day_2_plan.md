# Week 2, Day 2: Tuesday, July 19, 2022
## Synopsis

Implementing publication strategies.** The morning is devoted to HTML and CSS,
                which constitute the “view” aspect of the laboratory edition’s MVC architecture. In
                session two, participants return to the application in eXist-db and gain experience
                with application requirements. In the afternoon, participants deploy the first-draft
                edition within eXist-db with a session that implements the model, view, and
                controller together. To wrap up the day, we'll discuss unit testing and writing
                functions.

## Outcome goals
* Focus on the "view" in MVC in an eXist-db context.
* Introduce user-defined functions.
* Learn how to use `typeswitch` for dispatch.
* Connect the data model and view by writing a controller.
* Create good test writing habits.
* Modularize your code with user-defined functions.
* Write and run your first tests.
* Create the gazetteer model for use later.
* Learn how CI can alert you about regressions.
* Explore alternatives and methods.
* Evaluate whether the best visualization for your data is a map.
* Use external documentation and tutorials to create and adapt code for your project.
* Introduce external APIs.
