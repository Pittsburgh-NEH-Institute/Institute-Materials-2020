# Week 2, Day 5: Friday, 
## Synopsis

Finishing up. In the first session, participants will discuss and reflect upon the
                modeling choices made in development of the laboratory edition. These choices
                influence every part of the edition workflow, which participants will explore as
                they present on the interfaces, visualizations, and features they developed as part
                of their hands-on sessions, as well as their plans to apply their new skills to
                their own edition work. Finally, we survey resources for further education, and also
                allocate one-on-one time with instructors for participants to discuss application of
                what they have learned and developed in the Institute into their own editions.
