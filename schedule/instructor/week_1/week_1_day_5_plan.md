# Week 1, Day 5: Friday, July 15, 2022
## Synopsis

Collaborating on the edition. In session one we introduce the TEI ODD (One Document
                Does it all), a mechanism for documenting customizations to the TEI for
                project-specific purposes. Then, instructors lead small groups in applying ODD
                modeling to the laboratory edition. In session two we introduce GitHub Projects, a
                Kanban-style collaboration tool, and guide participants through debugging and
                resolving merge conflicts in Git. After exploring facets and fields on Thursday, we
                present the Advanced search feature in its final form and discuss the development
                journey for advanced features like this. A special topic session by Jeffrey Witt on
                the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), a community-focused
                Linked Open Data (LOD) standard for image sharing, closes the day.

## Outcome goals
* Enable better collaborative encoding for projects.
* Introduce Kanban and other software for task and issue management.
* Create pull requests on the institute repositories.
* Understand tracking branches, development branches, pull requests as branches.
* Become comfortable with merge conflicts and using Git.
* Understand the development process for creating advanced features.
* Use several advanced features in eXist-db to support research outcomes.

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups
