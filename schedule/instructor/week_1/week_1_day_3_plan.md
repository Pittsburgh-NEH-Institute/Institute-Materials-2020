## Synopsis

Moving from model to implementation. The third day is devoted to developing the
                digital editing workflow as a computational pipeline. Session one extends the
                command line skills introduced Tuesday. In session two we discuss applications of
                modeling to our laboratory edition, explore alternatives to TEI, and encode a sample
                document together. In the afternoon, we return to XQuery to create our first
                computational step in the pipeline. In a special topic session, Patrick Juola
                introduces stylometry as an example of integrating statistical description and
                evaluation into the perspectives exposed within an edition.

## Outcome goals
* Practice file management at the command line.
* Practice Git at the command line.
* Explore how data models and the computational pipeline work together.
* Navigate enabling and enforcing schema paradigms.
* Make explicit our assumptions about TEI, our data, markup decisions, and edition goals.
* Explore the relationship between research questions and markup decisions.
* Consider how the laboratory edition data might look different with different research questions and markup.
* Create our first computational pipeline together.

## Legend
