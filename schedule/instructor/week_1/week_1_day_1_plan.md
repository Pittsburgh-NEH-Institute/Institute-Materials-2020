# Week 1, Day 1: Monday, July 11, 2022
[Link to instructor-view navigation page](../daily_instructor_view.md)

## Synopsis

Fundamentals. The Institute opens with a high-level view of the types of engagement
                required by a textual editor, beginning (always!) from the research questions and
                leading to the production of an actual edition. In session two we introduce the
                computational pipeline as a way of modeling project development. We begin the
                afternoon by installing the software packages required for our Institute. Finally,
                we discuss some exemplary digital editions and start using XQuery to explore
                XML.

## Outcome goals
* Introduce everyone to one another.
* Make informed methodological and technical decisions based on our research questions.
* Set expectations for institute.
* Set goals. Practice describing goals.
* Understand base view processing and EDA.
* Explore decisions involved in conceptualizing a digital edition.
* Introduce XQuery with Shakespeare TEI in eXide.

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
