# Week 2, Day 4: Thursday, July 21, 2022
[Link to instructor-view navigation page](../daily_instructor_view.md)

## Synopsis

Data access and APIs. The morning sessions focus on accommodating both the
                developer-user and the eventual end-user. First, participants learn to collaborate
                using branches and implement semantic versioning. In the second session we introduce
                Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The afternoon’s session allows
                participants to profile and optimize their queries using Monex. The final session is
                reserved for review and catch-up.

## Outcome goals
* Evaluate whether the best visualization for your data is a map.
* Use external documentation and tutorials to create and adapt code for your project.
* Introduce external APIs.
* Understand CRUD, nouns, and verbs.
* Understand REST, HTTP, and URIs.
* Make an API call to [eXist-db](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/devguide_rest).
* Use branches effectively.
* Learn about version numbering.

We’ll end each day with a request for feedback, based on a general version of the day’s outcome goals, and we’ll try to adapt on the fly to your responses. Links to the feedback forms are in our Slack workspace in the #daily-feedback channel (posting from Mason on Mon, July 11).
