# Week 2, Day 4: Thursday, July 21, 2022
[Link to instructor-view navigation page](../daily_instructor_view.md)## Synopsis

Data access and APIs. The morning sessions focus on accommodating both the
                developer-user and the eventual end-user. First, participants learn to collaborate
                using branches and implement semantic versioning. In the second session we introduce
                Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The afternoon’s session allows
                participants to profile and optimize their queries using Monex. The final session is
                reserved for review and catch-up.

## Outcome goals
* Use branches effectively.
* Learn about version numbering.
* Understand CRUD, nouns, and verbs.
* Understand REST, HTTP, and URIs.
* Make an API call to [eXist-db](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/devguide_rest).
* Learn to optimize queries.
