## Synopsis

Finishing up (dessert and coffee?). In the first session, participants will discuss
                and reflect upon the modeling choices made in development of the laboratory edition.
                These choices influence every part of the edition workflow, which participants will
                explore as they present on the interfaces, visualizations, and features they
                developed as part of their hands-on sessions, as well as their plans to apply their
                new skills to their own edition work. Finally, we survey resources for further
                education, and participants have the opportunity to present to the whole group about
                their application of Institute concepts in their own editions.
