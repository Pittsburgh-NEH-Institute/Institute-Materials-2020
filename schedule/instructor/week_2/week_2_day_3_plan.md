## Synopsis

Visualization and interactivity. On day three participants learn to communicate
                information about data through interactive graphs and charts. In session one we
                introduce Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an XML technology that allows users to
                create data-driven charts and graphs with XQuery. The afternoon’s small-group
                hands-on session, with all instructors providing guidance, integrates these
                techniques into the edition for publication, as participants develop responsive,
                user-oriented visualizations exported and transformed from the laboratory edition
                data. Guest lecturer Elisa Beshero-Bondar teaches an extended special topic session
                on network analysis with text.

## Outcome goals
* Understand that SVG is an XML vocabulary.
* Think about the axes as infinite space, the viewport as a window onto that space, and the viewbox as a way to control the viewport.
* Draw and style circles, lines, and text with SVG.
* Discuss charting patterns and anti-patterns.
* Plan the model and inventory chart components.
* Learn about graphs, nodes, and edges.
* Learn about types of centrality.
* Model nodes and edges from the data.
* Extract model data in TSV format.
