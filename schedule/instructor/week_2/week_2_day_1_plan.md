## Synopsis

Planning for deployment. In week two, participants prepare the laboratory edition
                for publication, exposing the functionalities of querying, filtering, analyzing, and
                transforming textual data. In session one, we take stock of the progress of our
                collaborative edition and the work plan for completion. In session two we survey
                publication options like TEI Publisher and CETEIcean with comparative reference to
                GitHub Pages and the laboratory edition eXist-db implementation. In the afternoon,
                we learn HTML and CSS fundamentals to support *view* development in the following
                days. The special topic session will be a presentation on user experience and design
                by guest lecturer Shea Higgins.
