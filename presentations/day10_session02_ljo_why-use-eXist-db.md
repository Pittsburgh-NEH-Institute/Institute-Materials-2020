Day 10 Session 02 slot 01


We start with the question *When to use XML?*:

Answer: When you work with hierarchical data where sequence is important.

## What is eXist-db?
 * XML native database (https://exist-db.org/)

XQuery/XPath

 * The Lucene Full-Text Indexing is robust and
performant.
    * It includes configurable analyzers and
parameters,
    * and additional functions for working with
Lucene document fields.
    * Lucene indexing of binary files (conentent
extraction), e.g. pdf

management (xar archives) and repository
installation (hot deploy) of these packages

## Packaged together as one experience
 * Combining the powers of XML, XQuery with full

protocol (add more W3C standards)
and XAR package management bring you a
new level of convenience.
 * Using the eXist-db XML database and eXide
(eXist-db integrated development environment)
for web application development you have this
packaged together as one experience.



## Apps (a selection)
I already showed you a few already.
Usually the answer is there is an app for that, since eXist-db is probably the most feature rich XML database in the world. :)

* TEI publisher
    * Building a sharing community around it too, EEditiones
* Geospatial index
* Function documentation
* Charting
* Sparql + xml-serialized RDF index app
* TEI graphing app
* OCR app
