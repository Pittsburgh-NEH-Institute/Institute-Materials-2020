# What was successful about this project?
## Achievement 1: Research questions
- I do feel my edition meaningfully addresses the stated research questions and goals, as both a research tool and a pedagogical tool.


# What I would do differently

## Choice 1: Avoid images

- Copyright reasons
- Research resources
- Time investment

## Choice 2: Encoding choices

- This was the first TEI project I undertook. It shows!
- Data is less consistent
- Model building was often challenging
- Schemas are doing heavy lifting

## Choice 3: Using my personal research for a laboratory edition
- I wouldn't make a different choice, per se, but I might make the choice differently
- I've had three years to reflect and work on this...and I'm tired of working on this!
- The content of the institute has been challenging and rewarding in its own ways

## Choice 4: Scope definitions
- Defined scope in thesis significantly too broadly
- Ignored my own material limitations, repeatedly
- pr-app's final state is what I'd hoped to finish in two semesters(?!)

## Choice 5: Having a job
- Less of a choice and more of an ongoing burden...
- I've heard from many of you about this being a limitation for you within your academic job
- What do I find genuinely rewarding? I thought it was this, but it's this AND many other wonderful things.
- I keep learning and forgetting this lesson when I am interested in a project

## Choice 6: Delegate more
- Often I would say "No! I should be the one to do that!" while developing the app.

# What I could do next

## Choice 1: Move on
- I do not want to work on ghost stories any more
- I do want to work on more digital editions projects
- I have learned some valuable information about how to pick a dissertation project in the future

## Choice 2: Enhance features
- We talked about linking on the maps, improvements to visualization, enhancing the reading view
- Add some relevant images and CSS to enhance user experience
