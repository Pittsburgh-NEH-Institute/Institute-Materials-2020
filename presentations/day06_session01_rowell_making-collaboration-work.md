## Making Collaboration Work

### Discussion 1: Reflecting on Past Collaborations

Think of a past project. You may draw from your professional life (for example, co-teaching a course or carrying out a grant-funded project) or personal life (for example, planning a move or an event).

1. What were the most pleasurable parts of working with your collaborator(s)?

2. What were the most challenging parts of working with your collaborator(s)?

3. What contributed to making the experience of this project pleasurable and/or challenging?

### Discussion 2: Reflecting on Current Edition Collaborators

Think of a particular partner (for example, scholars, technologists, library workers, students enrolled in a course centered upon your edition, members of the public who are contributing through crowdsourcing). You can repeat this reflective exercise, answering this set of questions for each type of partner.

1. What will this partner contribute?

2. What is the value of the project **to the partner**?

3. What is the pattern of their engagement? For example, the **frequency** of their contributions (one-time, semesterly, monthly, daily or embedded). But also the **density** of their contribution (what authority they have over the nature of the project).
