## Intro to project management

I’m a librarian by training.
In my job as a digital scholarship librarian within an academic library, I partner with disciplinary faculty and technologists on scholarly digital projects.
They could be research projects, or they could be smaller projects based within courses.
I often find myself the de facto project manager on these project teams.

### What is project management?

A set of principles, methods, tools, and techniques for the effective management of objectives-oriented work in the context of a specific and unique organizational environment

**Speaker notes:** Let me call attention to a few characteristics in this definition:
(1) Principles, methods, tools, and techniques — in other words, structures for thinking and collaborating.
(2) Objectives-oriented work. You have set clear goals, likes Gabi’s research questions, research goals, and edition goals.
(3) Specific and unique organizational environment.
Sometimes I’ve found the disciplinary faculty I’ve worked with suspicious of project management practices because they seem so evocative of, well, everything that’s awful about being a worker in late capitalism.
I mean, I get it. I, too, am deeply suspicious of anything that dehumanizes workers and turns us into widgets.
That has not been my experience of project management practices, though.
I have found that project management helps to make collaborators’ implicit assumptions about the purpose and process of the work much more explicit.
As a result, I find working on scholarly projects that take a project management approach to be more pleasurable.
If you or your collaborators associate project management with the *evils of industry* perhaps you would find it more appealing to think about project management in the context of the arts, like stage management in a theatrical production.

### What are the goals of project management?

- Meet specified performance criteria
- Be within cost
- Be on time

**Speaker notes:** These three goals relate to each other.
For example, if you are falling behind on the work, and you have no flexibility on time, you could throw money at your project (hiring more staff to share the work, for example).
Alternatively, if you don’t have any additional funds, you could adjust the performance criteria to a lower level of quality in order to finish on time.
