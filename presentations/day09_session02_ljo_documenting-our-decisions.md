# Documenting our decisions

Day 09 Session 02 slot 03


## Connect back
Bring your results from Chelcie's exercises back from memory :)

 * Internal house keeping
 * External entitites
 * Tables, matrices, etc


### The stakeholders
 * Who are the the stakeholders?
 * What are the incentives for each stakeholder?
 * Who has the right to decide? Delegate if unclear.

### Maintain the collective project memory
 * Agree on project lifecycle and sub-task lifecycles (yes, some have other horizons)
 * Decide on the **single** location of your 
    * Suggestion simply add it under documentation in your git repository
```
project-root-dir/ --|
                   documentation/ --|
                                    static/ (please review for sensitive info)
                                    dynamic/
```
 * Tag your documentation with static (should not be changed)
 and dynamic (should be revised by schedule) to get the documentation in the correct location
 * Revise the dynamic documentation according to your intervals
    * Yearly, quarterly, montly, weekly etc
    * What are appropriate intervals for revising priorities?
 * Use git or other vcs
 * Decide what to do (in advance) if contributors step out
 * Decide what happens after the project EOL

## Document, document and document

 * I do not mean tons and tons of documentation 
 * But do document every type of decision: 

    * Document both positive and negative outcomes
    * Don't forget to document things that failed the prioritization race 
 or simply did not get into the final roadmap

 * Be attractive
     * source resorces and software
        * follow open standards
        * use open licenses 
        * indicate good enough
        * models (they are the most valuable assets of any software)
     * coding manuals
        * decisions, limits and possible continuations
    * provide user friendly APIs (no peepholes only)

# 
     * provide manually annotated materials and training materials (decide extent)
     * lists things to pick up for other parties
          * already prepped tasks, etc
          * and yes, it can be you in an off-spring project 
          (so think of your mother)

 * Contribute and collaborate
    * See: Be attractive
    * Give credit
    * Be helpful, it pays back!
    * Networks make you stronger
        * Use (student) ambassadors
        * Make it easy to add contributions to portfolio
