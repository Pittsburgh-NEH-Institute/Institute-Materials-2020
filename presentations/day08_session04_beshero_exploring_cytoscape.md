# Special topic: Using Cytoscape to visualize network relationships with Elisa Beshero-Bondar

This is part 2 of a two-part workshop on preparing a network analysis from digital edition data using XML. 
In this tutorial, we work with output of XQuery in the text format of tab-separated-values, import it to the network analysis software Cytoscape, and explore network analysis statistics and visualization possibilities.
