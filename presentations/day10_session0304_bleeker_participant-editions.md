# Participant editions
Week 2, Day 5: Friday, July 22, 2022;  
Session 3 and 4.

## Goal
Presenting to the whole group your application of Institute concepts in your own edition, discussing the choices you made in your editorial workflow and how these choices translate to your interface, visualizations, and edition features.

## Presenting your edition
Prepare a **five minute presentation** about your edition.   

### Suggested topics:
You can either present (your ideas about) your edition as a whole, or choose to focus on one particular aspect related to a topic we discussed in the past two weeks, e.g.

- The computational pipeline of your edition: what data do you have? What views would you like? How would you get from data to view? These questions can be discussed on a higher level _or_ you could present some of your data;
- User interfaces, perhaps following up on the wireframes you created [with Chelcie](https://pittsburgh-neh-institute.github.io/Institute-Materials-2020/presentations/day09_session03_rowell_project-planning.html);
- Data visualizations;
- Search, filter, or browse functionalities;
- Geo mapping;
- Network analysis;
- Text / image linking cf. IIIF;
- Stylometry;
- ...

### Suggested means of presentation:

- A walk-through of the app you have built during the Institute;
- One or more slides;
- Post-its;
- Wireframes (created using pen and paper, presented by taking a picture)
- ...
