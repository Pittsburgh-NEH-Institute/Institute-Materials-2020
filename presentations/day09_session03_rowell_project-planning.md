## Project management reflections

We've learned about project proposals and project charters (also known as project plans) as structures that help you to identify the intermediate steps of pursuing your research questions, as well as collaborative processes when working on a project team whose members have a wide range of experiences, perspectives, and expertise.
We've paid particular attention to some components that are commonly part of projects proposals and/or project plans:

- research questions, research goals, and edition goals
- audience...and *their* goals
- what's in scope, and also—crucially—what's out of scope
- project team expertise, roles, and responsibilities
- communication norms
- sustainability
- project tasks and schedule

Now let's reflect on what we've learned:

1. What aspects of project management do you find most intuitive and/or most likely to be helpful?
2. What aspects of project management do you find most counterintuitive and/or least likely to be helpful?
3. What questions about project management do you still have?
