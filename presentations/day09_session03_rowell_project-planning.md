## Project management reflections

We've learned about project proposals and project charters (also known as project plans) as structures that help you to identify the intermediate steps of pursuing your research questions, as well as collaborative processes when working on a project team whose members have a wide range of experiences, perspectives, and expertise.
We've paid particular attention to some components that are commonly part of projects proposals and/or project plans:

- research questions, research goals, and edition goals
- audience...and *their* goals
- what's in scope, and also—crucially—what's out of scope
- project team expertise, roles, and responsibilities
- communication norms
- sustainability
- project tasks and schedule

Now let's reflect on what we've learned:

1. What aspects of project management do you find most intuitive and/or most likely to be helpful?
2. What aspects of project management do you find most counterintuitive and/or least likely to be helpful?
3. What questions about project management do you still have?

## Planning our own projects

### A note about sketching

One aspect of the project plan that we haven't yet learned about together is wireframing—though I prefer the word 'sketching' because it feels more humanistic somehow!
For designers, initial sketches function as low-effort idea generators.
The goal is to give an idea enough structure to see what it reveals about the design situation and to invite comment, from oneself and others.
Most of the literature on sketching comes from product design and architecture, but information architects and user interface designers also sketch.
Web site maps and wireframes show structural components in schematic form and are a form of sketch.
At the beginning of a project, these representations are rough and tenuous, ready to be changed or scrapped.
As the project continues and the design begins to solidify, the sketches become more detailed and represent the results of one’s various design decisions.
At first, your sketches should truly be just sketches: loose, disposable, and multiple.
Later, your sketches will be more detailed: coherent and consistent, and showing enough to clarify what your finished website would look like.
Today we will sketch using paper and pencil.
Later in the process of developing your edition, you will be 'sketching in software.'
