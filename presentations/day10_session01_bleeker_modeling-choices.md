# Examining modeling choices from exemplary editions using what we know now.


### New perspectives on exemplary editions

In the past two weeks, we have defined the digital edition as a workstation that makes meaningful use of technology to address research questions, explore research materials, and share research results.

You have seen how research questions are fundamental in shaping the edition: they define modeling choices and inform the editorial methodology. 

### Talk lab
Let's reflect on some existing digital editions taking into account what we have learned. Navigate to the Institute's [overview of exemplary editions](https://pittsburgh-neh-institute.github.io/Institute-Materials-2020/ref/exemplary-editions.html) and select one edition from the list. Alternatively, you can pick an edition that is not on the list. Examine the edition with the following two questions in mind:

1. Which research question(s) does the edition addresses?
2. How do(es) the research question(s) tranlate to the edition's modeling and design choices?

You can think of:

* Scope of the edition;
* Selection of material;
* Presentation of material (primary and secondary);
* Interface(s);
* Navigation;
* Search functionality;
* Audiences;
* Accessibility (human/machine);
* Documentation
	- For collaborators: encoding guidelines, technical documentation, ...
	- For users: introductory texts, mouse-overs, API access, ... 
* Source resources, software, and standards:
	- Databases and data models;
	- Transcription princiciples, text markup;
	- Images;
	- Version control;
* Visualizations:
	- Networks;
	- Maps;
	- ...
* Citation, permalinks;	
* Sustainability, long-term accessibility and reusability of the material, licensing; 
* Outreach:
	- Pedagogical objectives;
	- (Social) media;
	- Spin-offs.
