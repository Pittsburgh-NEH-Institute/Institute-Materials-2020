# Presentations for the sessions
Here we put a pdf or markdown version of all presentations as they are delivered.
Sources are optional, but if possible, put in sources subdirectory.

Suggested naming convention: dayNN_sessionNN_author_title-without-spaces.pdf

- including a leading zero, e.g., 01, 02, 03, ... 10
- do not capitalize

For example: day01_session01_rowell_edition-goals.md
