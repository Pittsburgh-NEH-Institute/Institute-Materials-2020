2. Filenaming convention is *dayNN_sessionNN_author_title-without-spaces.pdf* (see notes and examples below).

### Notes about filenaming, with example

* Single-digit day and session numbers should have a leading zero, e.g., *day01* (not *day1*)
* Major sections of the filename (day, session, instructor name, title) are separated by **underscores**.
* Title is separated by **hyphens**.
* Example: *, e.g., *day01_session01_rowell_edition-goals.md*.
